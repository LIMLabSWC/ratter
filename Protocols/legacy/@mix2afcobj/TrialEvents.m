function TrialEvents(obj, action);    
%  
% Saves the events, during and after each trial. The events are saved in the
% SoloParamHandle 'LastTrialEvents'. The events consist of a matrix whos columns are:
% 1. The state
% 2. The action taken
% 3. The time of the action, according to the state machine
% 4. The resulting state
% 5. The time of the action, according to the nspike machine
% 
% The 5th column is only present when the data is collected on a machine connected to
% an nspike machine.
% 
% The actions correspond to the columns of the state matrix:
% 1 - center in
% 2 - center out
% 3 - left in
% 4 - left out
% 5 - right in
% 6 - right out
% 
% Note that this matrix is largely redundant with the LastTrialEvents matrix
% created by the call 'GetParam('rpbox', 'event', 'user');', commonly found
% in 'CurrentTrialPokesSubsection'. The functional difference is that that
% matrix does not have the nspike time (the 5th column). It is possible
% that one of these will 'disappear' in the near future.
%
% This function should be called during initialization, trial_finished_actions
% (cases 'end_of_trial_update' and 'push_history_then_reset'), and
% within_trial_update_actions.
